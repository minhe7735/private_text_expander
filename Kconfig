config ZMK_TEXT_EXPANDER
    bool "Text Expander"
    default n
    help
      Enable the text expander module. This allows you to define short codes
      that expand into longer strings of text, saving you time and effort for
      frequently typed phrases.

if ZMK_TEXT_EXPANDER

config ZMK_TEXT_EXPANDER_MAX_EXPANSIONS
    int "Maximum number of expansions"
    default 10
    help
      Specifies the maximum number of text expansions that can be defined.
      Each expansion consists of a short code and the expanded text.
      Increasing this value will consume more memory.

config ZMK_TEXT_EXPANDER_MAX_SHORT_LEN
    int "Maximum length of a short code"
    default 16
    help
      Defines the maximum number of characters allowed in a short code.
      Longer short codes can be more descriptive but may take longer to type.

config ZMK_TEXT_EXPANDER_MAX_EXPANDED_LEN
    int "Maximum length of expanded text"
    default 256
    help
      Sets the maximum length of the text that a short code can expand into.
      This should be large enough to accommodate your longest desired expansion.

config ZMK_TEXT_EXPANDER_TYPING_DELAY
    int "Typing delay (ms)"
    default 10
    help
      The delay in milliseconds between each character being typed when an
      expansion is triggered. A smaller value results in faster typing.

config ZMK_TEXT_EXPANDER_AGGRESSIVE_RESET_MODE
    bool "Aggressive reset mode"
    default n
    help
      When enabled, the current short code buffer is reset immediately if the
      typed sequence of characters does not match the beginning of any
      defined short code. This can help prevent accidental expansions but may
      feel less forgiving.

config ZMK_TEXT_EXPANDER_RESET_ON_ENTER
    bool "Reset on Enter"
    default n
    help
      If enabled, pressing the Enter key will clear the current short code
      buffer. This is useful if you use Enter to separate commands or text
      and want to avoid unintended expansions.

config ZMK_TEXT_EXPANDER_RESET_ON_TAB
    bool "Reset on Tab"
    default n
    help
      If enabled, pressing the Tab key will clear the current short code
      buffer. This can be useful in environments where Tab is used for
      navigation or completion.

config ZMK_TEXT_EXPANDER_RESTART_AFTER_RESET_WITH_TRIGGER_CHAR
    bool "Restart after reset with trigger character"
    default n
    help
      When aggressive reset mode is enabled, this setting determines the
      behavior after a reset. If enabled, the character that triggered the
      reset will be used to start a new short code. Otherwise, the buffer
      will be completely cleared.

config ZMK_TEXT_EXPANDER_ULTRA_LOW_MEMORY
    bool "Ultra low memory mode"
    default n
    help
      Enable this mode to reduce the memory footprint of the text expander
      at the cost of some features. For example, the character-to-keycode
      lookup table may be replaced with a simpler, less comprehensive
      function.
